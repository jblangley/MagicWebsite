# MagicWebsite
A side project for Magic: The Gathering card database and deck builder. Note: This used to be the Capstone Repository. Issues made it necessary to recreate the projecrt
The This project uses Visual Studios 2015 and SQL Server Managment Studios 2012.
I use MVC, N-Tier model in ASP.Net.
There is script of the Tables And Stored Procedures I used to set up the database. It is still labeled Capstone because no changes needed to be made to the database
